# Story
In Class 28, you learnt how to make an elastic constraint called a slingshot for the Angry
Bird.
In this project, you will have to practice and apply what you have learnt in the class and
create a mango plucking game in which you have to add a launcher for the stone, which can
be moved with a mouse.
